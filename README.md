# Steven Galloway
Senior Technology Executive & Engineer | Data, ML & Cloud Architecture

I design and build scalable systems across machine learning, data engineering,
and cloud platforms. This GitHub is intentionally organized by technical domain
to make review fast and intuitive.

Each repository includes documented tradeoffs, architectural decisions, and production considerations - not just code.
